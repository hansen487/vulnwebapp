# vulnwebapp
The application was hosted with WAMP on my local machine, so the following instructions apply to WAMP.
In order to get WAMP (or Apache) to host the application, simply drag all files into the "www" folder in WAMP or Apache.
On my local machine, the credentials for the database are username: "root" and password: ""
The once WAMP is launched with the files added into its "www" directory, the application can be accessed by typing "localhost/index.html"
